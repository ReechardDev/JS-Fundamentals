# JS-Fundamentals

This repository contains JavaScript exercises for the ALX Front-End Development program.

Each script demonstrates basic concepts of JavaScript, including:
- Variables and constants
- Loops
- Conditionals
- Functions
- Command-line arguments (`process.argv`)

All scripts are written in Node.js and tested locally before submission.
